# Research, documented

## Overview

This is a repository for documentation for all my research. Documentation here is meant to be
accessible by others, not to be confused with casual research writings I might store in my
[research repo][reporef-research].

I would like the documentation here to be understandable, relatively un-opinionated, and
*instructional* (or, technical?). Maintaining documentation for all of my research projects in a
single place makes some sense, and for anything opinionated or insightful (analytical?) I will
simply refer to my [research website][webref-research].
